My favourite string function from the string library is strcpy, because strcpy helps really very much to copy a string value of a variable to an other string 
variable. This actually have been useful, because in some occasions it was not possible to copy the values with an uqual. For example when I used in my code the strcpy 
function to copy the name of the customer for the creation of a new ticket. Whenever I was trying to copy the value to an other variable with the equal it was 
prompting some errors, so it was much better using the strcpy. When I copied the name of the agent it was initially difficult because I didn't know where to take the 
agent name then I realized that I had an unmodifiable array of account that contained the information related to the Agent that logged in.

I created the function prototype void getTicket(struct Ticket* ticket); for adding a new ticket, some values that had to be automatically added I added them directly 
in the agent's menu and the other ones in which the user had to write the input for example the message and the subject I typed those in the getTicket function. I
added the function prototype to the ticket.h header file and its function definition to the ticket.c source file, the main reason to add it to ticket.c was that it was a 
new ticket so it was much easier to remember whenever I had to modify anything in it and in the header file I already had the Ticket structure.
An other function that I created was void activate(struct Ticket* ticket); essentially for making the activity status from 0 to 1, that means from CLOSED to ACTIVE
I added the function prototype to the ticket.h header file and its function definition to ticket.c source file, the reason was the same as getTicket function, so
it was easier to find because it was related to the ticket status and it also contained the Ticket structure.
The last function that I created was void close(struct Ticket* ticket); essentially for making the activity status from 1 to 0, that means from ACTIVE to CLOSED
I added the function prototype to the ticket.h header file and its function definition to ticket.c source file, the reason was the same as getTicket and activate 
function, so it was easier for me to find because the activity is related to the ticket and it also contained the Ticket structure.
