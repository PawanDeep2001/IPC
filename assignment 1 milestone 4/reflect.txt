1)the output that has to match exactly to the output that is actually needed
it is furstrating, because that makes even spaces and new lines very relevant,
no doubt it is very important the spacing and all for getting a aligned and 
tidy output.
obviously it is long to continue and input all the answers again and again
but in the end we can say it is quite cool to have a correct output. 
but in my opinion in a certain way this might not be really good because if 
someone faces just one error he can not submit it that's why we even cannot 
score intermediate marks, only 0 or 100 is annying because we made so much 
effort just to not submit it.
2)naming libraries with a good name is right because libraries or modules
has to be named like the content that that library or module has.
modules for example we need to name those modules in a good way because 
when we need to call those modules we need to remember those and address those
names direcly with the module for example in a struct we need to remember 
the name of thatstruct directly.
3) in this assignments we made some menus that open other manus, and we have 
a 0 to come back, the menu makes the user have many choices and do exactly 
what the user wants, and he has the possibility to leave the application.
the advantages of the cascading menu is that the user can choose wisely 
what he needs to open this application that we made could be easily be used by
the bank workers to access to the customers accounts and to modify or remove
accounts from their servers that in our case was the array containing maximum
50 accounts that obviously we can increase by just changing the max size
