struct PlayerInfo
{
	int lives;
	char character_symbol;
	int counter;
	int history[maximum];
};
with structures we can easily store different type of data, like in this example we can store the player information, we can store integer values, characters
in a single structure.
in this case we store the number of lives of the player, its symbol, a counter for the trasures found, and the history of the previous moves, that is an array.

2)
to make this workshop record more than one game we need to create a nested structure the first one will include an array with the player identifier like his name,
and within the player structure there will be a second structure with PlayerInfo and it has to contain an other array that contains the end-results of the players.
in the main() we need to create an other loop for the whole process, that will repeat according to the  numbers players, that will be an other input.

3)
I spent a lot of time figuring out how to diplay this msg """("\n============== = > Dope!You've been here before!\n\n");"""
then I realized that I just need to do a simple if  comparing (player.history[i]==1 && i + 1 == moves), because player.history has to be 1 but the i+1 has to be 
equal to the move that the user printed in moves.
